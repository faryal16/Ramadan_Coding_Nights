# Simple Chainlit Chatbot

This repository contains a basic chatbot implemented using the Chainlit library. It echoes back to the user what they have typed.

## Overview

This chatbot demonstrates a minimal working example of using Chainlit for building conversational AI applications. It receives messages from the user and responds by simply repeating the message back to them.

## Functionality

*   Receives user messages.
*   Echoes the received message back to the user.

## Code Explanation

The code consists of a single Python file, `main.py`, containing the following:

*   **`import chainlit as cl`**: Imports the Chainlit library, aliased as `cl` for brevity.  Chainlit provides the necessary tools to build the chatbot interface.
*   **`@cl.on_message`**:  A decorator that registers the `main` function as a handler for incoming messages from the user. Whenever the user sends a message, this function will be executed.
*   **`async def main(message: cl.Message)`**: An asynchronous function that processes the user's message.  It receives a `chainlit.Message` object as input.
*   **`response = f"You said: {message.content}"`**: Creates the response string.  It accesses the content of the user's message using `message.content` and formats it into a simple "You said: ..." string.
*   **`await cl.Message(content=response).send()`**:  Creates a new `chainlit.Message` object containing the response and then sends it back to the user using the `send()` method.  The `await` keyword is used because Chainlit operations are asynchronous.

## Customization
- This is a very basic example. You can extend it to:
- Implement more complex logic to process user input.
- Integrate with other APIs and services (e.g., for information retrieval, language translation, or       sentiment analysis).
- Create a more sophisticated user interface.
- Add support for different message types (e.g., images, files).
- Refer to the Chainlit documentation (https://docs.chainlit.io/) for more details and advanced features.
