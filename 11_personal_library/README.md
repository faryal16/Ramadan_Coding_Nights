```
âœ… Book added successfully!

### ðŸ“œ Viewing Reading Progress
Displays the total books and the percentage of books read.

## ðŸ“‚ Data Storage
- Books are saved in `books_data.json`.
- Each book entry follows this format:
  ```json
  {
      "title": "1984",
      "author": "George Orwell",
      "year": "1949",
      "genre": "Dystopian",
      "read": true
  }
  ```

## ðŸ›  Troubleshooting
- **Book not saving?** Ensure `books_data.json` exists and has write permissions.
- **Data not loading?** Check if the JSON file is correctly formatted.
